    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example showing how the scikit-learn can be used to cluster\n",
    "documents by topics using a bag-of-words approach. This example uses\n",
    "a scipy.sparse matrix to store the features instead of standard numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two feature extraction methods can be used in this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - TfidfVectorizer uses a in-memory vocabulary (a python dict) to map the most\n",
    "    frequent words to features indices and hence compute a word occurrence\n",
    "    frequency (sparse) matrix. The word frequencies are then reweighted using\n",
    "    the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) vector collected feature-wise over\n",
    "    the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - HashingVectorizer hashes word occurrences to a fixed dimensional space,\n",
    "    possibly with collisions. The word count vectors are then normalized to\n",
    "    each have l2-norm equal to one (projected to the euclidean unit-ball) which\n",
    "    seems to be important for k-means to work in high dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    HashingVectorizer does not provide IDF weighting as this is a stateless\n",
    "    model (the fit method does nothing). When IDF weighting is needed it can\n",
    "    be added by pipelining its output to a TfidfTransformer instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two algorithms are demoed: ordinary k-means and its more scalable cousin\n",
    "minibatch k-means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, latent semantic analysis can also be used to reduce\n",
    "dimensionality and discover latent patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be noted that k-means (and minibatch k-means) are very sensitive to\n",
    "feature scaling and that in this case the IDF weighting helps improve the\n",
    "quality of the clustering by quite a lot as measured against the \"ground truth\"\n",
    "provided by the class label assignments of the 20 newsgroups dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This improvement is not visible in the Silhouette Coefficient which is small\n",
    "for both as this measure seem to suffer from the phenomenon called\n",
    "\"Concentration of Measure\" or \"Curse of Dimensionality\" for high dimensional\n",
    "datasets such as text data. Other measures such as V-measure and Adjusted Rand\n",
    "Index are information theoretic based evaluation scores: as they are only based\n",
    "on cluster assignments rather than distances, hence not affected by the curse\n",
    "of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: as k-means is optimizing a non-convex objective function, it will likely\n",
    "end up in a local optimum. Several runs with independent random init might be\n",
    "necessary to get a good convergence.\n",
